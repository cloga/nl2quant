Pass it as `freq` or define it globally under `settings.array_wrapper`.\n```\n\nThis error indicates that the time‑series index used in the backtest does not have an associated frequency (e.g., daily, hourly). Without a known frequency, the library cannot annualize metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, total return, or drawdown calculations.\n\n**Suggested Fix**  \nSpecify the data frequency explicitly by passing the `freq` parameter (e.g., `freq='D'` for daily) or set it globally using the `settings.array_wrapper` configuration. Once the frequency is provided, the backtest can compute the expected metrics (Sharpe, return, drawdown, etc.)."
